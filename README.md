# CDC AI Persona Tester

An internal web tool for the CDC team at TSTC to test AI-powered case study personas. This application allows for interaction with custom AI characters designed to simulate realistic behavioral health scenarios.

## 🧠 About

This tool enables the CDC team to interact with AI personas—**Nick**, **Jane**, and **Sarah**—each crafted with rich backgrounds and behavioral profiles. Prompts can be typed in and sent to simulate conversations, helping to refine and evaluate AI-driven case studies before instructional rollout.

## 👤 Personas

- **Nick** — A 21-year-old former economics student struggling with addiction and unresolved trauma.
- **Jane** — A 30-year-old sex worker dealing with meth addiction, paranoia, and social instability.
- **Sarah** — A 27-year-old recently paroled mother facing systemic barriers while working toward family reunification and sobriety.

Each persona operates within a predefined system prompt and remains in character throughout the interaction.
